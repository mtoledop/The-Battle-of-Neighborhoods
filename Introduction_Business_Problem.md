## Introduction/Business Problem
An investment group wants to set up a chain of gyms with a revolutionary concept in Andalusia. As part of their initial plan they want to locate their first headquarter in Seville (the capital) in a place where there are many gym users to be able to attract them.
The key to choosing the location of the headquarter is to observe the "traffic" of customers. It must be a central place very close to the gymns where there is the highest traffic.
